# raincheck

This is an app that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to check if it's raining in your area. If it is, Twilio sends a text message to your phone as a heads up.

### Why?
I live on a street prone to flooding, so I often need to move my car when it rains heavily. Hopefully this will help forewarn me and I can avoid another flooded car!
